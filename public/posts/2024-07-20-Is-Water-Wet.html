        <p>
          I've had lengthy debates on this topic for years now. It seems that
          every couple of years this question will be posed in one place or
          another and will once again spark conversation and great division
          among people who are otherwise in complete agreement. I myself have
          had great fun attempting to argue my stance on the argument to those
          of varying degrees of debate prowess.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, being the overanalyzer that I am, I have noticed similar
          threads in these debates every time that I have them that lead me to
          believe that the issue is even more nuanced than I initially believed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While much of the time has been spent in a direct conflictual debate,
          one of person vs. person, opinion vs. opinion, I tend to find myself
          leaning towards dialogue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dialogue(or discussion) rather than debate(or argument) is much more
          effective at producing solutions and understanding. When one or both
          parties are focused on convincing the other side that they are wrong,
          very little headway can be made in the direction of finding the actual
          truth. This is because typically both parties are singularly focused
          on 'winning' rather than understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my observations, it is much more common for parties to have a lack
          of understanding rather than an outright disagreement on a topic.
          Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of outright disagreements where
          people understand the other parties' position and opinions explicitly
          and disagree, but I have found that it is far more common to see
          ineffective communication leading to disconnects of understanding
          between the parties, which leads to further arguments and debates.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was with this mindset that I reevaluated the liquid conundrum and
          attempted to parse the past debates I have had, with the intention of
          understanding those whom I originally was trying to convince.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that the majority of the misunderstandings led back to a
          singular disconnect. That of definition. The entire debate hinges on
          semantics, and the definition of the adjective "wet" covers most
          semantic qualities of the word. This was not a novel concept to me, as
          during many of the arguments I based my stance on the "objective"
          truth of the dictionary definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The breakthrough was found when taking into consideration the
          relationship a dictionary has with the language it represents. When
          considered from a broad point of view, many consider a dictionary to
          be the ultimate authority on a language, one that solidly defines the
          meanings of words and phrases to police the communication that takes
          place using the language. However, this could not be further from the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dictionary is not, and will never be, the final authority on
          language as long as there exists a population actively communicating
          with the language. Rather, a dictionary exists to document and reflect
          the population of active users of a language. If our dictionaries were
          written during the earlier times of the English language, many words
          and phrases would have wildly different definitions based on how the
          language was used at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that true, objectively correct semantic definitions for
          problems such as this do not exist, as the personal cultural usage of
          a word varies greatly from individual to individual, from community to
          community. This means that when it comes to issues that hinge entirely
          on semantical definitions, such as "is water wet," disagreeing parties
          can both be objectively right in their stance on the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this revelation does not please the part of me that yearns for
          objective facts, it helps greatly in my further pursuit of achieving a
          greater understanding of those I find myself in debate with. I believe
          that many issues can be resolved with effective communication, and
          understanding these fundamental ideas that can cause such major
          disconnects should enable me to more effectively communicate and
          understand others in the future.

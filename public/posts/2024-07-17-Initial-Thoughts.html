          Why did I decide to start blogging? It is a little complicated, but in
          reality it all comes down to my mental health. Ever since early high
          school and the COVID pandemic, I have struggled with maintaining
          mental clarity and state of mind. I attribute a large portion of this
          to the social isolation that I have been experiencing during this
          time. Sure, I've had my family to fall back on, who have been a major
          resource and have kept me sane, but family is not the same as peers.
          Additionally, the social stigma behind opening up about feelings and
          showing weakness as a male has contributed significantly to my closing
          myself off from the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This closure is incredibly unhealthy and contributed to many thoughts
          and conversations building up inside me without any outlet through
          which to purge them or share them. After researching this type of
          issue online many people say that it has been helpful to them to begin
          journalling as a way to externalize their thoughts. I've tried this in
          the past, but can never be consistent with sitting down and writing
          every day in a book I don't think anyone else will ever see. In a way,
          journalling made me feel more alone than before, because I knew that
          no one would ever care or see what I wrote, and so it didn't seem to
          matter.
        </p>

          This leads me to the present. I recently began seeing videos
          reccomended to me on youtube about the personal web or the indie web.
          This idea that the old internet still exists was fascinating to me,
          and I began chasing down ways to bring it back. I spent hours
          replacing algorithms with rss aggregators and apps with blogs, and
          looked through hundreds of interesting personal sites and blogs. This
          was a reveletory moment to me. My understanding of the current state
          of the internet was that of reposts on reddit, dishonesty on
          instagram, and algorithm-chasing on youtube and elsewhere. These new
          personal sites I was finding showed genuine uncensored humanity. No
          ads. No pandering to what companies want to hear. No chasing likes or
          subscriptions or fake internet points. Heck, I found a guy who has
          spent years documenting all towns and cities named Bristol! This was a
          side of the internet I had never seen before, and I desperately wanted
          to participate.
        </p>

          I've had a sort of blog site before, but it was mainly used for
          tutorials, and I didn't really have much else besides that because I
          wanted to portray a similar facade to what I saw on social media like
          youtube. With this new knowledge of what blogging could be, I saw the
          potential this could have on improving my mental health. It is a fun,
          creative, incredibly expressive and artistic outlet that I can use to
          journal in a way that I can pretend might reach some people. On top of
          that , I can get as nerdy with it as I want, and do it all without any
          sort of pressure to perform or conform to anyone or any set of rules.
          I can say whatever shit I feel like. If I feel like cursing, I can
          fucking curse, and while others may be able to read what I write, they
          don't have to have any say at all in the content that I produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          While these concepts aren't <em>entirely</em> new(many creators
          produce content on other sites and apps with this mindset), at the end
          of the day there is always those internet points staring at you,
          affecting your decisions and deciding the value of your content. These
          are absent from personal blogs, and people can happily write daily
          blogposts about whatever crosses their mind for <em>years</em> without
          ever receiving a comment or like, and with potentially not a single
          soul seeing what they wrote. The appeal of this concept is undeniable,
          and so here I am, spinning up a site of my own. Maybe someday I'll
          implement commenting or an rss feed, or maybe someday I won't. No one
          is looking anyway. Growing up my parents always told me, "Remember who
          you are." I don't plan to forget, and everything written on this
          blog/site/journal/whatever you want to call it will be
          unapologetically me.
        </p>

          Part of being so alone for so many years has made me become very good
          at having internal dialogues with myself. Back and forth arguments,
          philosophical debates, and intense self-doubt have been regular
          conversations in my head during times of silence and solitude. I am
          hopeful that having a medium with which to externalize these dialogues
          and thoughts may help my mental state to clear as I realize what I
          truly believe and feel. That or I'll forget about this blog
          completely, decide its too much work, and take it all down in the
          morning. Who knows really?

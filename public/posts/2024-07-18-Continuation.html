        <p>
          Yesterday's post came on a little strong I think, but it still set a
          good foundation for what I hope to use this blog for. It was late at
          night when I was writing that post, as I was unable to sleep because I
          had a cup of coffee that morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strange relationship with coffee and caffeine in general. I
          suspect that I may have ADHD, but caffeine doesn't seem to put me down
          like it does for many ADHDers. Instead, it has the typical effect of
          increased focus, jitters, and inability to sleep. However, it has some
          strange side effects. I've noticed that on days in which I have coffee
          (never after noon and only one cup) I tend to get a sort of sensory
          overload headache around 5pm that lasts until I eventually fall
          asleep. This sensory overload was initially mistaken for a form of
          misophonia, as my father has the condition and I suspected I had the
          same. Indeed, many symptoms are the same, with increased irritability
          to people talking or small noises but my brain also just generally
          feels like it is under attack, and the headache portion of it is
          overwhelming and mentally deafening.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just give up caffeine, then." The problem is that caffeine has a give
          along with this take. This heightened sensory state can be manipulated
          to my advantage if my space is quiet and regulated. Several times I
          have used it to trigger a state of hyperfocus toward whatever
          obsession I am working on at the time, during which I can accomplish
          seemingly superhuman amounts of work over the course of several hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was in high school I was drinking coffee or energy drinks
          daily, and I built up a tolerance to the negative side effects
          mentioned above, but also unfortunately the same was true of the
          positive effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I typically use it as a tool, saving it for the once or twice a
          month in which I'd like a greater chance of triggering a state of
          hyperfocus or am in dire need of help staying awake. This results in
          some days in which I have coffee and am unable to keep a clean, quiet
          environment, and overstimulation leads to a state of angry, energetic
          outbursts as I attempt to get my brain to shut up for a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the state in which I wrote last night's post, and contributed
          to the overall tone and aggresiveness of my writing. Eventually I hope
          to be on top of my sleep schedule enough that I will not have to rely
          on caffeine as often, and can avoid these intermittent side effects
          (and the following sleep loss) whenever possible.

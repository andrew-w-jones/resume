This is a Cloud-based Portfolio site built using AWS utilizing CloudFront, Route 53, and S3 linked to a DynamoDB NoSQL database accessed via an HTTP API running serverlessly through AWS Lambda. It was deployed using automation linked to GitHub to achieve a CI/CD deployment model. It is currently set up only to statically host my resume and a small blog, but upgrades are possible for future learning endeavors.
